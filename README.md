This is a weather dashboard that will allow the user to generate current city weather condistions based off of the user's search that was entered. Third party-based API's were used to access weather data.

- User can either enter a city to search for or click on a button for a previously searched city to get the current weather and five day forecast.
- Event listeners using jQuery were used in order for the user to search for a city. This is also used for past cities and to clear the search history.
- Bootstrap was used for styling and creation of cards for each day of the five day forecast.
- Bootstrap was used for the rows, containers and columns
- Clean simple UI with graphical representation of weather
- Moment.js is used to convert unix timestamp to MM/DD/YYYY format
- Background color of UV index will adjust based on World Health Organization color scale
